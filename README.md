# esp8266MqttRelayBoard
Project for a relay board powered by a esp-12e communicating with a MQTT server

Experimental projects for a esp8266 (esp-12e) driven relay board communicating with the MQTT protocol.
I'm planning to use these with openhab to drive loads with a not high power consumption.
Everything in this project is still experimental so make your valutations before using this material.
